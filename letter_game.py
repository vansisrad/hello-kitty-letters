    "devyani": "Devyani 🦦 — To my Dearest Devu, I don’t even know where to start this letter from. First of all, thank you for being in my life. I have never connected with someone so fast. I used to think I was so weird, and my jokes were so lame, and I would never fit in with people, but when you laughed with me at my jokes, you got what I was saying, I felt so happy. With you, I have never felt judged, never felt sad, never felt like I needed to be someone else. I don’t think I will ever find someone to laugh and make jokes with me like you do. I honestly am scared if I will ever laugh so much with anyone else than you, so I'm sad that I won't be able to run to your room just to show u a funny reel and knowing you'll laugh at it too, to make u wake up from ur naps just to sit on ur bed and eat ur head, I wont be able to fight with u like boyfriend girlfriend in mess, pathway, room, outside class and food truck area, emotionally blackmailing you to come to our room and saying “jab main chali jaungi na tab dekhna” and I cant even believe bolte bolte voh time aa bhi gaya. I’ll miss us eating atbc together, ill miss us forcefully flirting with tassu, ill miss us dancing and watching kissing videos (hehe), ill miss u finishing my afghani momos and ill miss talking with amogh and aunty also. \n\nDevu aapke saath jitna main khush rehta tha I think no one can ever make me that happy. I had forgotten how to laugh staying home, but thank you for making me so happy and making me feel so so so so loved. Thank you for appreciating me, thank you for not making me feel alone even tho our courses, classes, were so different. I see our selfies everyday and I miss you a little extra when I see some lame reels and reel trends. Ill miss our chutku chutku fights, ill miss our gossip sessions, ill miss calling you for no reason. Thank you for being the most precious, loving and most of all being my second home. I hope ive not troubled you too much and giving me love more than my own family. Thank you for listening to my rants, thank you for making me feel better because I actually thought could never feel happy, maybe god listened and sent me you to make these 3 years the most years of my life with less crying and more laughter.\n\nI honestly don’t know what ill do without you all, Im very scared and I don’t know how to suvive the coming days without seeing you faces. I feel nothing can make me strong enough to overcome this. Its like my purpose of living has left me, but ill try to be happy and do something so I can ear and get you stuff hehe. I hope you do your graduation with the most happy days and a lot of success. Ill miss you a lot and I love you so much I don’t think even words can describe it. I hope we are best friends in every universe because Id make this decision again  in every lifetime. 🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡\n",
    "shazia": "Shazia 🪼 — Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii shazuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu. This is for the coolest person I know. Thank you for being my first friend, I was so scared to come in Jindal, I had no idea what to do, who to to ask but you were there. You were so patient, so kind I think that moment I actually thought I can survive Jindal and I did all because of you. We started as roomates in a room but at the end that room became my home and you became family. My motivation to run from class in that burning dhoop to room was to meet you and just talk with you before you left for class. I think ive never bragged about casper jitna ive bragged about you and tassu being my roomates. Shayad aapki life mein maine unknowingly nazar lagadi because I used to brag about you to my family, my classmates, my school friends everyone I knew. That room was the happiest place I could be because if you, I wanted to miss my classes just to talk and chat with you. Shazu youre the most understanding, the most sensitive and the most comfortable person to talk to. I think aadhe doubts in life mere aapne clear karein hai, I think half of my problems were giving me less anxiety kyunki uspe “shazu toh hain na” ka tag lagg chuka tha. You always pretended everything is okay even though aap dukhi thei, aapne humesha sabko pehle attention di hai when you also needed someone. I wish I had become that person for you but maybe next time we meet:). Ill miss us bantering, ill miss making faces at ur fashion hauls, ill miss lecturing you about expenditure, ill miss you lecturing me over life, ill miss talking to you, ill miss listening to ur songs in the morning, ill miss telling u things I couldn’t tell anyone about. I have always felt sad when you didn’t come to college, mughe itna mann kartha ki subah ho jaaye and shazu will be here unpacking her things. From me seeing clothes as kya hi hai isme to always thinking ki what would shazu say about this, yeh shazu ko acha lagta is smth which can never change. Ill miss us hanging out, ill miss our deep talks, ill miss making my cheap jokes with you. \n\nShazu you are more than family to me. I don’t know how will I manage to not listen to ur voice and see ur face on daily basis but we ball we stay strong that’s what you’ve taught me. You’ve taught me to live life, to be a better person, to see good in other people, to think, to believe , to keep hope and always reassuring everything will be fine. I don’t know wholl tell e that everything is fine when nothing is. I don’t know who will I go and talk to when I feel smth is not right, I don’t know who can I be myself with now, I don’t know who can I take fashion advice from, I don’t know who will tell me to be happy in life when I am not. As I write this I feel sad that now ill have to be alone but I know ill always remember us. Ill always move forward remembering us, ill always remember to eat less meetha because of you, ill always remember a tv reference because of you and ill always remember the best roommate and family I could ask for and god gave me better than what I asked. \n\nI’ll always remember you shazu, ill always be here for you, ill always support you, ill always listen to you and ill  always love you to the moon and till infinite galaxies in this universe. Thank you for bring my family which I missed out on, thank you for loving me just like a family, thank you for worrying for me, thank you for taking to me , thank you for listening to me, thank you for coming in my life and loving me till the end. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️\n",
    "tasmia": "Tasmia 🐙 — TASSUSUSUSUUUSUSUSUSUSUUSU. You are my favourite I don’t think ive hidden the fact ever. Thank for being my survival kit tassu and thank you for being better than my family, thank you for being my everything and my family literally , I really would have not able to do this without you there is no way no way at all. You have seen me in my worst and the best and no matter you’ve always been there to support me. Thank you for being in my life, I have ot thank god to letting you come in my life, I love you so much. Jab bhi mughe dikkat hui hai I have always thought arey yaar agar nhi hoga toh tassu se pocch loonga, par ab pata nhi kisse poochunga. Tassu we met on my first day and I was so scared of you but abhi fast forward karkar I would like to tell my old self that this person becomes your lifeline and your everything. Thank you so much tassu for listening and thinking about me so much. Ive never known someone like you and im so lucky to find you in my life tassu. Main soch bhi nhi sakta main rehta kaise aapke bina aur aage bhi kaise reh paunga. I love our walks together, I love us eating south Indian together, I love us worrying about devu, I love pouring my heart out to you, I love saying anything I want without being judged infront of u. I think ive never felt anxious in my situations when youre there because you gave me such comfort such love, such homely feeling. I think main ghar se kabhi kabar jaldi nikal jaata tha taaki aapse mil loonga aur baatein kar loonga. Main bohaut khush rehta hoo aapke saath, you understand me even before I say anything, u read me so well, u know me so well, u take efforts for me thank you tassu I really don’t know how will I go on life without telling you about the smallest details about my day. \n\nI loved you watched documentaries with me even tho u wanted me time, you asked what happened when  I wasn’t able to express myself, I think can never bring justice to how much you think and do things for me. There is a reason you are my favorite person in the whole universe and the reasons are about 1001001010101010. Or even never ending, ive spent the most time with you, and I only long for more. Thank you for taking interests in what I liked, thank you for listening to me I know how depressing it was but you still listened I hope tassu I can always make u feel comfortable and homely when you feel down. I will always love u tassu, ill miss u so much, ill try to survive without you which will be so hard but ill make u proud and be happy that I can atleast tell u more if nothing good happens. I hope tassu u don’t stress too much in life, I know u don’t tell others, u don’t like sharing but seeing u stressed makes me feel bad, please be happy, everything will be okay, ill always be there for you, ill always be here to listen and make you laugh. Have a good 4th and 5th year and stay slay always I love youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu* infinite, Ill miss u sososososososososososos oh god so much. 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓\n",
    "samridhi": "Samridhi 🦆 — Helloooooooooooooooo SAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. The mom of our group, the most understanding and caring friend I've ever had. Mera dinn bhi agar bura jaa rha hota tha aur aap room aate thein na, mera mood apne aapk sahi ho jaata tha. It’s the energy you brought. Ive never felt negative around you, ive always felt like sab acha kyun hai itna. It became better for me when you started coming at 7 am In the morning, tab toh mera poora din acha jaata tha. I don’t think you understand how and where you stand in my life. Youre the most precious osul I have ever met. Thank you for impacting my life in such a wholesome and with such love. Sometimes I just used to come in ur room to feel ur presence and be happy. I miss u everytime I see a friend group playing games, I miss you everytime I see people doing yoga in the morning and a little extra when I see reels of desi dance trends on insta, its like aajkal sab aapki hi yaad dillata hai. I feel sad when I don’t feel the same positive and homely feeling with others and think who will make me feel this way now? But samridhi whenever I felt sad you were always there to talk to me, even tho you were dealing with your own problems you still listened you still patted my back, you still said “vanshika kuch khaalo, kuch peeogi?” Mughse ab yeh sab kon puchega. Main kisko hasaungi aur kiski baton pe itna hasoongi, kiske paas jaungi jab sab annoy kar rahein hote hai aur ek sane person ke paas jaaakr sabki chugli karni hoti hai, Kisko dekhungi subah yoga karte heui, kisko padhaungi exams ke liye?? \nKoi na. I wish in every Janam we are friends like this, in every universe we have rooms next to each other, in every universe I see you dancing and see your reels,in every universe I see your outfits, in every universe I see you stressing and pacing here and there for ur exams, in every universe I wake you up after 15 minutes just for you to tell me 5 minute aur, in every universe our thoughts and ideas match and we say “sahi mein yaar”, In every universe we tell eavh other ek aur game yaar, in every universe we stand in that balcony and see people and talk, in every universe we got to class together, in every universe I help you pack your stuff, in every universe I console me and say koi na. I hope im always a person you can rely on and be comfortable to talk to when you feel down because I love you so much and ill miss you even more.💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗\n"
